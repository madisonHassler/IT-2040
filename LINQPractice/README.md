LINQPractice.zip Download LINQPractice.zip

In the Program.cs is pre-written code in which LINQ statements are to be placed to make the program function as described.

The data to be queried with LINQ statements is based on the following class and enumeration that are in Product.cs and ProductCategory.cs.

The following is the Product class.

```
using System;

namespace LINQPractice
{
    public class Product
    {
        private int _productID;
        private ProductCategory _productCategory;
        private string _title;
        private double _price;
        private int _stockedQuantity;

        public Product(int id, ProductCategory category, string title, double price, int stockedQuantity)
        {
            ID = id;
            Category = category;
            Title = title;
            Price = price;
            StockedQuantity = stockedQuantity;
        }

        public int ID {
            get { return _productID; }
            set {
                _productID = value;
            }
        }

        public ProductCategory Category {
            get { return _productCategory; }
            set {
                _productCategory = value;
            }
        }

        public string Title {
            get { return _title; }
            set {
                _title = value;
            }
        }

        public double Price {
            get { return _price; }
            set {
                _price = value;
            }
        }

        public int StockedQuantity {
            get { return _stockedQuantity; }
            set {
                _stockedQuantity = value;
            }
        }

        public override string ToString()
        {
            // note: {1:F2} indicates the second variable (first is 0, second is 1) with 2 digits after the decimal point

            return String.Format("ID: {0}, Price: {1:F2}, Stocked Qty: {2}, Category: {3}, Title: {4}", ID, Price, StockedQuantity, Category, Title);
        }
    }
}
```

The following is the ProductCategory enumeration.

```
using System;

namespace LINQPractice
{
    public enum ProductCategory
    {
        Computers,
        Electronics,
        Kitchen,
        Pet
    }
}
```

In Program.cs an array of Product instances are created that serves as the data collection to be queried.

```
Product[] products =
{
    new Product(1252, ProductCategory.Computers, "Logitech M510 Wireless Computer Mouse", 18.49, 25),
    new Product(1343, ProductCategory.Computers, "Redragon K552 KUMARA LED Backlit Mechanical Gaming Keyboard", 29.99, 9),
    new Product(1542, ProductCategory.Computers, "Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB (2x8GB) DDR4 DRAM 3000MHz", 139.99, 42),
    new Product(1721, ProductCategory.Computers, "USB 3.0 A to A Cable Type A Male to Male, 3 feet", 7.29, 112),
    new Product(2231, ProductCategory.Computers, "USB C to USB A", 10.99, 84),
    new Product(2405, ProductCategory.Computers, "EVGA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti Gaming Video Card, 4GB GDDR5", 169.99, 25),
    new Product(2502, ProductCategory.Computers, "ASUS ROG Strix Z370-E Motherboard LGA1151 ", 209.99, 8),
    new Product(3152, ProductCategory.Electronics, "Tascam DR05 Stereo Portable Digital Recorder", 92.99, 14),
    new Product(3178, ProductCategory.Electronics, "Toshiba 43LF621U19 43-inch 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV HDR", 319.99, 23),
    new Product(3556, ProductCategory.Electronics, "Crown XLS1502 Two-channel, 525W at 4â„¦ Power Amplifier", 399.00, 17),
    new Product(4339, ProductCategory.Kitchen, "KitchenAid KSM150PSER Artisan Tilt-Head Stand Mixer", 278.63, 36),
    new Product(4411, ProductCategory.Kitchen, "Hamilton Beach 62682RZ Hand Mixer", 14.99, 67),
    new Product(4523, ProductCategory.Kitchen, "Tovolo Flex-Core All Silicone Spatula", 10.49, 98),
    new Product(5134, ProductCategory.Kitchen, "Circulon Symmetry Hard Anodized Nonstick Skillet", 49.95, 62),
    new Product(5216, ProductCategory.Pet, "Neater Feeder Express Pet Bowls", 22.99, 6),
    new Product(5678, ProductCategory.Pet, "Magic Roller Ball Dog Toy", 10.80, 9),
    new Product(6123, ProductCategory.Pet, "Pillow Pets Signature Cozy Cow Plush Toy", 19.99, 17),
    new Product(6732, ProductCategory.Pet, "Evriholder FURemover Broom with Squeegee ", 15.99, 21),
    new Product(7128, ProductCategory.Pet, "Fabreze Pet Oder Eliminator", 4.94, 33),
    new Product(7231, ProductCategory.Pet, "Professional Pet Slicker Rug Brush for Dogs", 7.59, 17)
};
```

Following the the array of Product instances are a series of LINQ queries that are to be performed and the results displayed. For each LINQ query, write a non-functional LINQ statement and a functional LINQ statement to retrieve the requested data.

The first practice item is already completed in the provided project as a demonstration of what is to be done.

The first practice item has the following comment at the top of it that indicates the query to be performed.

```
/*-------------------------------------------------------*/
/*  Practice Item ID: 1                                  */
/*  Get a list of the products that have prices in range */
/*  between $10.00 and $20.00 (inclusive of endpoints).  */
/*-------------------------------------------------------*/
```

In the block of code for Practice Item ID: 1 are two variables where the two LINQ statements are to be placed. The first one is to be a non-functional LINQ statement and the second one is to be a functional LINQ statement. Both statements yield the same results, they are just two different ways to write LINQ statements.

The following code shows how the two statements are presented before the solution is created.

```
var productsWithPricesInRange10To20 = <write a non-functional LINQ statement here>;

var productsWithPricesInRange10To20Functional = <write a functional LINQ statement here>;
```

Where is says <write a non-functional LINQ statement here>, a non-functional LINQ statement is to be placed. Where is says <write a functional LINQ statement here> a functional LINQ statement is to be placed.

The following code shows the two LINQ statements (the solution) for Practice Item ID: 1.

```
var productsWithPricesInRange10To20 = from product in products where product.Price >= 10.00 & product.Price <= 20.00 select product;

var productsWithPricesInRange10To20Functional = products.Where(product => (product.Price >= 10.00 & product.Price <= 20.00));
```
                                                                                                                            
With the LINQ statements in place, the existing code in the program loops through the results and displays them as shown below.

```
                                                                                                                            
Notice that the results from the non-functional and functional LINQ statements are the same...as they should be.

The second practice item is the first one you need to work on. There are a total of 14 practice items requiring both non-functional and functional LINQ statements. Since the first one is done, that leaves 13 with two statements each for a total of 26 LINQ statements that need to be written for this challenge.

The second practice item has the following comment at the top of it that indicates the query to be performed.
```
/*-------------------------------------------------------*/
/*  Practice Item ID: 2                                  */
/*  Get a list of the products that have prices in range */
/*  between $10.00 and $20.00 (inclusive of endpoints)   */
/*  ordered by lowest to highest price.                  */
/*-------------------------------------------------------*/
```
The code below it is commented-out. Uncomment statements in the second practice item and write the two LINQ statements. The following is in the code for the second practice item.
```
var productsWithPricesInRange10To20OrderedByPriceAsc = <write a non-functional LINQ statement here>;
var productsWithPricesInRange10To20OrderedByPriceAscFunctional = <write a functional LINQ statement here>;
```

Where it says <write a non-functional LINQ statement here>, a non-functional LINQ statement is to be placed. Where is says <write a functional LINQ statement here> a functional LINQ statement is to be placed.

After writing the statements, test them to see that they work.

How you work through the items is up to you. You could do all the non-functional statements and then do all the functional statements. Or, you could do the non-functional and functional statements for each item as you work through them. Use comments to comment-out code that isn't part of what you are working on as you work through the items. I'd recommend you only try to write and test one LINQ statement at a time.

The solutions for each statement (non-functional and functional) for each practice item is provided in the module on Canvas. Each solution is in a separate document so one at a time can be revealed in Canvas. Do not look at a solution until you have made a valid attempt at a solution yourself. If you truly get stuck and can't get a statement to work, then look at the solution and learn from it...and move on to the next item to try again. Since the solutions to Practice Item ID: 1 are already presented in this document and in the supplied project, check them out on Canvas so you can see how solutions are presented.

The following is the output of the program when all the LINQ statements are in place.
